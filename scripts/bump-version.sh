# Bump the project version across EVERY manifest in lockstep (root + mobile + electron +
# client-core + shared package.json, apps/mobile/app.json, bun.lock, and Cargo.toml/Cargo.lock),
# ensuring all manifests stay synchronized with the release tag. Also regenerates nix/bun.nix (the
# flake's npm dependency set) from bun.lock when nix is available.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/bump-version.sh [options] <x.y.z>     # set an explicit version
#   scripts/bump-version.sh [options] <x.y.z-rc.N> # set a pre-release (cut on the dev branch)
#   scripts/bump-version.sh [options] patch       # bump the patch component (x.y.Z -> x.y.Z+1)
#   scripts/bump-version.sh [options] minor       # bump the minor  (x.Y.z -> x.Y+1.0)
#   scripts/bump-version.sh [options] major       # bump the major  (X.y.z -> X+1.0.0)
#
# patch/minor/major need a stable current version; from an rc, name the version (x.y.z-rc.N+1, or
# x.y.z to promote). Only x.y.z and x.y.z-rc.N are accepted. Android's versionCode is derived from
# the version by scripts/version-code.mjs (it always grows, rc or stable); the version string itself
# (-rc.N and all) is the Android versionName, which accepts it.
#
# Options:
#   --no-notes   don't regenerate RELEASE_NOTES.md
#   --desktop    also build the desktop tarball (scripts/package-desktop.sh) for the new version
#
# Re-running with the current version only verifies that every manifest agrees; it leaves
# RELEASE_NOTES.md alone, so reviewed notes are never overwritten.
#
# After running: review `git diff` (the regenerated RELEASE_NOTES.md is part of it -- it becomes
# the release notes for the tag), commit as `chore(release): vX.Y.Z`, then tag `vX.Y.Z` to release.
#
# Needs only bash and node (no GNU sed, no python), so it runs the same on Linux and macOS.
