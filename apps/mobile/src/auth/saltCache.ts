/**
 * Per-account cache of the KDF salt and the KDF the account last derived with, in AsyncStorage.
 *
 * Both are public data — the server hands them to anyone who asks (it must, for zero-knowledge
 * login) — so caching them leaks nothing and only saves a round trip: on a repeat login the
 * (comparatively expensive) key derivation can start while the fresh `/auth/salt` response is still
 * in flight. The fresh response still verifies the cached values on every login, so a rotated salt
 * or a newer KDF costs one extra derivation, never a wrong-password failure.
