 * Everything that must be settled before the app (and its store and sync) may mount: a server that
 * refuses this build's sync protocol shows the update screen, and a locked session (signed in, no
 * unwrapped keys) the unlock screen. The account app renders only with both a session and a
 * keyring, so sync never starts without keys, and only after any local-only data has been moved
 * into the account (`LocalUpgradeGate`). An account without a registered recovery key is also
 * asked, without blocking the app, to confirm its phrase.
 *
 * With no session the app runs in local-only mode (see `localMode.tsx`), unless the sign-in screen
 * was asked for. Without a `LocalModeProvider` (tests) there is no local mode: the sign-in screen.
 *
 * Lives under `src/` so it is testable without the router.
