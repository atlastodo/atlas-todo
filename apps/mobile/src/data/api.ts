 * blobs (`blobFetch`: Expo's native fetch on Android and iOS, the default in a browser).
 *
 * Token options are passed at construction because the `tokenStore` is read-only on the client: a
 * 401 rotates the refresh token through it, and the app must persist the new pair or the next cold
 * start signs the user out. `AuthProvider` is the caller.
