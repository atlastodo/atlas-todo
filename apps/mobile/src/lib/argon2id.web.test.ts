/**
 * The web build's Argon2id (hash-wasm's WebAssembly) against the shared vectors: the reference
 * implementation's own, and whole login derivations. A mismatch with the other platforms would lock
 * an account made on one out of the others. Jest resolves the base `.ts`, so this names the web
 * file directly; importing it registers it, as the app's entry does.
