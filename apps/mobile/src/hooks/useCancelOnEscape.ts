 * Escape cancels what is being typed: it discards the draft and leaves the field. The companion to

 * No platform split: react-native-web routes `onKeyPress` to a DOM keydown, and native reports only
 * character keys, so the branch never fires on a phone. react-native-web's TextInput calls
 * `stopPropagation` on every key event, so this is the only place Escape can be handled while a
 * field has focus; the global hotkey layer never sees it.
