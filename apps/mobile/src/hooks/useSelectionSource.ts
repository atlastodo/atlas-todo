/**
 * Register a list's tasks as the current selection source, so "select all" works from any list
 * surface without threading ids through every screen, and prune the selection as the list changes.
 *
 * Two sets answer different questions:
 *
 * - `shown`: the rows on screen (a collapsed group's rows are excluded). It is what "select all"
 *   means, registered via `setVisibleIds`.
 * - `known`: every task the list contains, collapsed groups included, defaulting to `shown`. The
 *   prune runs against this: pruning against `shown` would drop a selected task that is merely
 *   off-screen (collapsed, or absent for a frame during a re-derive).
 *
 * Only the focused screen participates. The drawer/tabs keep visited screens mounted, so a
 * background list would leave its ids in the shared slot ("select all" grabbing another view's
 * tasks) and prune the focused screen's selection. A selection is also scoped to its view: it is
 * cleared when the list loses focus.
