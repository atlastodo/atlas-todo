 * pointer event, which anchors the paint (`paintBegin`). The drag itself is driven by the
 * provider's document-level `pointermove` hit-test, not per-row `onPointerEnter`, because the row's
 * `GestureDetector` captures the pointer on the anchor. The `dataSet` marker (`data-atlas-row`) maps
 * the element under the cursor back to a task id; `onPointerEnter` is kept as a fallback. Metro
 * resolves this over the native no-op `usePaintHandlers.ts`.
 *
 * Handlers are wired only in select mode, so a normal click is untouched. `useSelectionOptional`
 * returns null without a provider, so the row still mounts in isolation (with no handlers).
