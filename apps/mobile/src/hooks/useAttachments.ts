/**
 * Task attachments, the `attachment` entity kind. The metadata rides the ordinary sync outbox like
 * a comment; the descriptive fields (filename, mime) live inside the encrypted `meta` envelope
 * (`__aenc:1`, keyed by the file's own AEK), so rendering a row unwraps the AEK with the task's
 * scope key (the project's PEK, else the personal DEK). A row whose meta cannot be read still
 * shows: the plaintext `blob_size` and `blob_sha` give a generic placeholder.
 *
 * The upload is the durable `AttachmentQueue` from the store context: `add` encrypts immediately
 * (works offline), lets the queue make its first blob attempt, then kicks sync so the metadata,
 * released after that attempt, goes out. Deletion is a soft-delete; the server's blob GC reclaims
 * the bytes later.
 *
 * Read-time trash cascade: an attachment whose task is trashed (or gone) hides with it, so no
 * device has to tombstone it separately.
