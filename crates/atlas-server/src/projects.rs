//! E2EE project-key distribution: the key-material exchange sharing needs and sync cannot carry.
//!
//! `project_keys` is an append-only history per `(project, user, key_id)`. A `wrapped` row is the
//! user's own copy; a `sealed` row is an owner's signed delivery sealed to the user's X25519 key.
//! A shared project has one canonical key ([`CANONICAL_KEYS`]); when a key holder leaves, a
//! rotation is requested ([`request_rotations`]) and an owner completes it. Details are in
//! `docs/architecture.md`.
