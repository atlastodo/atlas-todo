# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately, not in a public issue or pull request.

[Open a private advisory](https://github.com/atlastodo/atlas-todo/security/advisories/new) through
GitHub's private vulnerability reporting.

Include a description, the affected version or commit, and steps or a proof of concept. You will
get an acknowledgement. Once a fix is released, you are credited in the release notes if you
want to be.

## Supported versions

Atlas Todo is pre-1.0. Only the latest release gets security fixes. Please check that the
problem exists in the latest release (or on `main`) before you report it.

## Scope

- The server (`crates/atlas-server`): authentication and sessions, key distribution, sync,
  attachments and the admin API.
- The clients: local stores, the sync client and the encryption (`packages/client-core`,
  `apps/mobile`, `apps/electron`).
- The container image and compose setup (`docker/`, `compose.yaml`).

## Threat model

Atlas Todo assumes the server may be curious. An operator, or someone who stole a database dump,
should not be able to read your tasks. It does not assume the server is fully hostile; see
[Known limitations](#known-limitations).

How the cryptography works is in [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md#end-to-end-encryption).
This page lists what it protects.

### What the server cannot see

- Every field value is encrypted on the device with AES-256-GCM before it syncs, unless the
  field is on the plaintext list below. That covers titles, notes, dates, priorities,
  recurrence, project, section and label names, comments, reminders, saved filters,
  preferences, focus sessions and habits.
- Attachments are encrypted with a fresh key per file, and file names and types are encrypted
  too.
- A field that nobody has put on the plaintext list is encrypted by default.
- Each value is authenticated together with its entity type and id, its field name and the key
  scope. The server cannot move a value to another field, task or project and have it open.
- Values are padded to a size bucket, so size does not tell `true` from `false`, or a short
  title from a slightly longer one.
- Your password and master key never leave the device. The server stores only a hash of a login
  value derived from it.
- The server has no copy of your recovery phrase.

### What the server can see

- Your email address, account dates and sessions.
- For every change: the entity type and id, the field name, the time of the edit and the size
  bucket of the value.
- Field names include those of the key trust records, which name the projects you accepted or
  shared, the members you invited and the accounts whose keys you pinned or verified. The server
  knows who shares projects with you anyway.
- Project membership: who shares which project, with which role.
- Public keys and wrapped (encrypted) keys.
- Attachment sizes and the SHA-256 of each encrypted blob.
- Bug reports, which carry diagnostics only and no task content.
- Request IP addresses, which the rate limiters hold in memory. They are not stored in the
  database.

### Fields that stay plaintext, and why

The list lives in [`test-vectors/plaintext_fields.json`](./test-vectors/plaintext_fields.json).
The client encrypts by it, and the server checks that every field value it reads is on it.

| Entity         | Plaintext fields                                          | Why                                                                          |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| task           | `project_id`, `assignee_id`                               | the server copies shared-project ops to members and checks access            |
| section        | `project_id`                                              | same fan-out and access check                                                |
| comment        | `task_id`                                                 | routes the comment to the task's project members                             |
| activity       | `task_id`, `actor_id`                                     | routes the feed entry and names who made the change                          |
| attachment     | `task_id`, `blob_sha`, `thumb_sha`, `wrapped_key`, `meta` | routing and blob addressing; `wrapped_key` and `meta` are already ciphertext |
| project_member | all                                                       | written by the server itself                                                 |

All other entities (project, label, preference, saved filter, reminder, focus session, habit,
habit check-in) have no plaintext fields.

### Recovery phrase

- Signup shows a 24-word recovery phrase (BIP-39). If you forget your password, the phrase is
  the only way back. The server sends no reset emails and cannot decrypt your data.
- Lose both the password and the phrase and the data is gone.
- If you lose the phrase or think someone has seen it, create a new one in Settings while signed
  in. The old phrase stops working at once. Anyone who knows your password can do the same, so
  if you suspect that, change the password first.

### Keys the server hands out

The server distributes project keys, names each project's canonical key and lists members with
their public keys. The app does not trust that on its own. It acts only within what you did, and
keeps a record of your decisions as encrypted, synced preferences that the server cannot forge.

- A project key sealed to you is loaded only for a project whose invite you accepted.
- A key you minted when you shared a project stays that project's canonical key, whatever the
  server names.
- A public key is pinned the first time you see it, when you invite someone. The project key is
  sent only to pinned members and only to that key. A member whose key changed is shown as
  "encryption key changed" and gets nothing until you remove and re-invite them.
- Identity keys of every account are pinned on first sight. A differing key is never adopted,
  and the deliveries it signs are refused.
- Owners sign every key delivery. The app loads a delivery only if the signature verifies under
  the signer's pinned key.
- The app moves a value to another key only within one project. It never re-encrypts a personal
  value for a project, or one project's value for another, unless you share a project or move a
  task.
- When someone who held a project's key leaves it, the key is rotated and the new one goes,
  signed, to the remaining members. The app never goes back to a retired key.

Trust on first use means a server that swaps in its own keys at the moment you first see a
member would not be noticed. Safety numbers close that gap: compare the number the share dialog
shows with the member in person or on a call, then mark them verified. The mark is dropped if
their keys change. A member you have not verified is only as trustworthy as the server was when
you first saw them.

### Upgrading from a pre-public build

Installs from before the first public release migrate automatically. The first sync of the updated
app rewrites old-format values in the current bound format and records the key trust baseline from
the keys the device holds; the next password sign-in moves a PBKDF2 account to Argon2id. Until that finishes, the server could
move an old-format value between fields under the same key, and a PBKDF2 login hash is cheaper to
brute-force. Fresh installs are not affected.

### Known limitations

- A rotation protects what is written after it. A removed member keeps the keys they had and can
  still decrypt older content they obtain later, for example from a database leak. Until an
  owner's app, which has to be online, has rotated the key, members keep writing under the old
  one.
- The server cannot read your data, but a malicious one can attack its integrity. It cannot move
  an encrypted value to another field, item or project. It can drop or replay operations,
  including an older value of the same field, delete items and change the plaintext fields.
- The key trust records are ordinary synced data. The server can withhold them or delete the
  preference that holds them. That only delays new records on an existing device, but a new
  device that never receives them loads no project keys.
- Attachments added by older versions have file keys not bound to the attachment, so the server
  can copy one onto another attachment under the same key. When you share or move the item, the
  app re-wraps the key for the new scope and it is bound from then on.
- The web app is served by the server. Whoever controls the server controls the JavaScript the
  browser runs and could steal keys from web users. The Android and desktop apps bundle their
  own code.
- Android builds with Expo Updates enabled fetch JavaScript updates from the Expo project named
  by `ATLAS_EAS_PROJECT_ID`. Builds made with `ATLAS_EAS_PROJECT_ID=none` never do.
- Metadata is visible: when you are active, how many items you have and which fields you edit.
- The app does not encrypt data on your devices. Each client keeps synced data unencrypted in its
  local database (SQLite on Android and iOS, IndexedDB in the browser and desktop app) and
  relies on the app sandbox and device encryption. Signing out deletes the database, after
  warning about unsynced changes, and deleting the account always does.
- In the browser, session tokens are in `localStorage` and the unlocked keys are wrapped under a
  non-extractable WebCrypto key in IndexedDB. A copy of the profile yields the keys, and an XSS
  bug can unwrap them while the page is open. The desktop app wraps the keys with the OS key
  store through Electron's `safeStorage`, so a copy of the profile alone does not open them, but
  other programs running as you may. On Linux without a keyring it falls back to the browser's
  wrap. See [the architecture notes](./docs/architecture.md#key-storage-on-the-client).
- The recovery phrase on the clipboard is marked sensitive on Android and cleared after a
  minute, but clipboard managers, iOS Universal Clipboard and keyboards that ignore the flag may
  keep a copy. Writing the phrase down is safer.
- A password change re-wraps the data key and does not rotate it.
- The salt lookup names an account's KDF, so for PBKDF2 accounts it also shows that the account
  exists.

## Not vulnerabilities

- Anonymous bug reports. `POST /reports` accepts unauthenticated callers on purpose, so a crash
  before sign-in can still be reported. It takes an allow-listed diagnostics payload and is
  rate-limited per IP (`REPORT_RATE_LIMIT_*`). Set `BUG_REPORTS_ENABLED=false` to turn it off.
- Open CORS. The API uses bearer tokens, not cookies, so allowing any origin (the default when
  `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is unset) is safe and intended.
- Placeholders in `.env.example`. The server refuses to start with an empty, short or known
  placeholder `JWT_SECRET`.

## Running your own instance

- Serve it over TLS, set a random `JWT_SECRET` (`openssl rand -hex 32`), and keep PostgreSQL off
  the public internet.
- Behind a reverse proxy, set `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_TRUST_FORWARDED=true` so the per-IP limits see
  real client addresses. Only do this if the proxy is the only way to reach the server, because
  clients can forge `X-Forwarded-For` otherwise.
- Back up both the database and the attachment storage. Attachments are end-to-end encrypted, so
  a lost blob cannot be recovered from anywhere else.
