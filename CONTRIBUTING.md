# Contributing to Atlas Todo

Thanks for your interest. Atlas Todo has a Rust server, one React Native + Expo UI for Android,
the web and the desktop, and a TypeScript client core. This guide covers the setup, the checks
and how changes get merged. For a map of the code, start with
[docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md).

For anything larger than a small fix, open an issue first so we can agree on the approach before
you write code. Everyone taking part follows the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Development environment

The environment is defined with [devenv](https://devenv.sh) (Nix). It pins Rust, Node 26,
Bun 1.4.2, PostgreSQL, sqlx-cli and the other tools.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<you>/atlas-todo.git
cd atlas-todo
cp .env.example .env   # set JWT_SECRET (openssl rand -hex 32)
devenv shell           # enter the environment
devenv up              # start PostgreSQL; leave it running in its own terminal
db:migrate             # apply the migrations
dev                    # API on :8080 + the web app with live reload
```

- The first `devenv shell` builds sqlx-cli from source, which takes about a minute.
- devenv starts PostgreSQL on a free port and derives `DATABASE_URL` and `TEST_DATABASE_URL`
  from it. Keep database settings out of `.env`: devenv loads it and it would override them.
  The dev database is `atlas_dev`, the test database is `atlas_test`, and the user and password
  are both `atlas`.
- The server refuses to start without `DATABASE_URL` and a valid `JWT_SECRET`.
- The web app talks to `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`, which defaults to `http://localhost:8080`.

### Android SDK (optional)

The Android SDK is several GB, so it is off by default. Expo Go (`mobile:dev`) and the EAS cloud
builds don't need it. To turn it on for your machine, create a `devenv.local.nix` in the
repository root (it is gitignored):

```nix
{ android.enable = true; }
```

Then leave and re-enter `devenv shell`. The scripts that need the SDK tell you this when it is
off.

## Scripts

All of these run inside `devenv shell`. The root `package.json` has no scripts.

| Script                             | What it does                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dev`                              | API (cargo watch) and the Expo web dev server                    |
| `web:dev`                          | the whole local stack in one command                             |
| `mobile:dev`                       | Metro for a phone running Expo Go                                |
| `desktop:dev`                      | API, web and the Electron app with live reload                   |
| `desktop:start`                    | export the web bundle and run Electron against it                |
| `desktop:package`                  | build the desktop tarball                                        |
| `nix:bun-lock`                     | regenerate `nix/bun.nix` after a `bun.lock` change               |
| `db:migrate`, `db:reset`           | apply or reset the migrations                                    |
| `test:all`                         | every test suite (see below)                                     |
| `lint`                             | rustfmt check, clippy, TypeScript checks, ESLint, Prettier check |
| `fmt`                              | rustfmt and prettier                                             |
| `emulator:start`, `mobile:android` | Android emulator and native dev build (needs the SDK)            |
| `version:bump`                     | release helper, maintainers only                                 |

The full-suite script is `test:all`, not `test`: a script named `test` collides with the shell
builtin.

## Tests

`test:all` runs, in order and stopping at the first failure:

1. `cargo nextest run --workspace`
2. vitest in `packages/client-core`, `packages/shared` and `apps/electron`
3. jest (jest-expo) in `apps/mobile`

`lint` runs `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --no-deps -D warnings`,
`tsc --noEmit` for `packages/shared` and `apps/mobile`, `eslint .` and `prettier --check .`.
`fmt` fixes the formatting. CI also typechecks `packages/client-core` and `apps/electron`. If you
touch them, run `cd packages/client-core && bun run typecheck` or
`cd apps/electron && bun run typecheck`.

Each package has its own runner. To run one test:

- Rust: `cargo nextest run -p atlas-server <name>`
- `packages/*` and `apps/electron`: `cd packages/shared && bunx --bun vitest run src/foo.test.ts`
- `apps/mobile`: `bun run test -- <pattern>`. This must run under Node, not Bun's runtime, or it
  fails at load with `Attempted to assign to readonly property`.

Where the tests live:

- `crates/atlas-core`: unit tests next to the code, and `tests/` for the shared vectors. No
  database needed.
- `crates/atlas-server/tests/`: integration tests over HTTP. They need PostgreSQL running
  (`devenv up`) and migrate `TEST_DATABASE_URL` themselves.
- `packages/*/src/*.test.ts`, `apps/electron/src/*.test.ts` and `apps/mobile/src/**/*.test.tsx`:
  next to the code they test.
- `test-vectors/`: JSON fixtures that both the Rust and the TypeScript tests read, so the two
  sides agree on conflict resolution, recurrence, recovery challenges and the plaintext field
  list. The merge rules exist in Rust (`crates/atlas-core`) and in TypeScript
  (`packages/client-core`), and both sides read `test-vectors/plaintext_fields.json`. If you
  change one side of that logic, change the other and extend the vectors.

## Adding or changing UI text

All user-facing text goes through i18next. The catalogs are in `packages/shared/src/locales/`:
English (`en.json`, the base), Danish, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Polish and
Brazilian Portuguese (`pt.json`).

1. Add the key to every catalog, at the same path. For a plural, `en.json` has `_one`/`_other`;
   each other catalog has its own language's plural forms (Polish `_one`/`_few`/`_many`/`_other`).
   If you can't write a language, add the English text to its catalog and say so in the PR.
2. Use it with `t("section.key")`.
3. Run the two checks:
   - `cd packages/shared && bunx --bun vitest run src/i18n.test.ts` checks that every locale has
     exactly the English keys, in its own plural forms, and is valid UTF-8.
   - `cd apps/mobile && bun run test -- i18n/keys` checks that every literal key the app uses
     exists in every locale.

A new language also needs an entry in `packages/shared/src/i18n.ts` and a quick-add lexicon in
`packages/shared/src/quickAddLexicons.ts` (its words for today, tomorrow, weekdays, months, "in 3
days", "every week" and times), with cases in the "every UI language" table of
`quickAddParse.test.ts`. The settings and onboarding text about smart dates quotes examples in the
language; they must parse.

## Commits and pull requests

- Commit messages and PR titles follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org):
  `feat:`, `fix(mobile):`, `refactor(sync):`, `docs:`, … Release notes are generated from the
  commit log, so write the subject for users.
- Keep a PR to one change. Explain what and why, and how you tested it (platforms, screenshots
  for UI changes). The PR template has a short checklist.
- Run `lint` and `test:all` before you open the PR. CI runs the same checks.
- Add tests for new behaviour.
- Don't edit a version number. Versions move in lockstep across all manifests and only change
  in release commits.
- Don't commit secrets, keystores, `.env` files or build output (`dist-desktop/`,
  `atlas-desktop-*.tar.gz`).
- Security problems go through [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md), not a public issue or PR.

### Branches and releases

Work lands on the long-lived `dev` branch; open pull requests against `dev`. `main` holds stable
releases only. A push publishes nothing: the maintainer tags pre-releases (`v0.1.4-rc.1`) on `dev`,
and when one is good, merges `dev` into `main` through a pull request (`main` takes no direct pushes)
and tags the stable `v0.1.4`. Pre-releases go to
GitHub as prereleases, to Docker as `0.1.4-rc.1` and `dev`, and to the Play internal track. Details
in [apps/mobile/RELEASE.md](./apps/mobile/RELEASE.md).

### What CI runs

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every pull request and on pushes to `main` (pushes to `dev`
run nothing; an rc tag runs the full suite):

| Check             | What it runs                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lint (Rust)       | `cargo fmt --check`, clippy with `-D warnings`                                |
| Lint (TypeScript) | typecheck of shared, client-core, mobile and electron; ESLint; Prettier check |
| MSRV              | `cargo check` on the minimum Rust version (1.94)                              |
| Test (Rust)       | `cargo nextest run --workspace` against PostgreSQL 16                         |
| Test (TypeScript) | vitest in client-core, shared and electron                                    |
| Test (mobile)     | jest in apps/mobile                                                           |
| Audit (Rust)      | `cargo deny check` (allowed to fail)                                          |
| Audit (JS)        | `bun audit` (allowed to fail)                                                 |

The audits are informational. A known, unfixable advisory is explained under `//audit-known`
in the root `package.json`. Fixable advisories are fixed with `overrides`, not ignored.

## Bug reports from the app

The app's _Report a problem_ screen sends a report to the server it is connected to. It shows up
in that server's admin panel, not in this repository. To report a bug in Atlas Todo itself, open
a GitHub issue.
